Project Objective

The main objective of this project was to create a calculator to operates with the four basics Math Operations.

Challanges

This was my second calculator project. On my first project creating a calculator, I inicially choose to work with function "Eval" and changing value on HTML with "inner.HTML". As I seached later, these methods are not recommended due risk to web pages being hacked.
Having the last informations in mind, I created a full logics to the operation of the calculator and changeed value on HTML using more safety methods.

As a plus for this challenge, I also could add to this project the functionality about using the keyboard to operates the calculator.

This challange and project was my final assignment on Fron End Developer Program on Brannest Company.

It really helped me on my coding and I hope you enjoy testing my project.
